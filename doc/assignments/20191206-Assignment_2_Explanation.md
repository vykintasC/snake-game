# Assignment 2

## Exercise 1
We chose the follwing classes for our class diagram:

* User
* Score
* Board
* Food
* Snake
* SnakeTail
* Tail

We chose these classes because they are the core part of the game and what the user interacts with mainly.
Without the Board we can't show the game and without a Snake the game isn't much fun. The SnakeTail and Tail classes were chosen because they are very important for the user experience and without them the game wouldn't become any more difficult than avoiding just walls. The food is also integral to the gameplay since it allows our user to accumulate points and to make the game more difficult (once food gets eaten the snake grows). The score class is heavily related to the user since this is what the user is trying to improve. Since all these classes are built around a user and provide functionality to said user we couldn't exclude the user class from this diagram.
